This instruction is for Ubuntu. At the moment, FreeEed is not supported in Windows or Mac, 
but you can look at sample processing results in the sample-output folder.

1. Unzip the distribution. We will call the place where you unzip it "the distribution directory".
One possible place is ~/FreeEed

2. On the command line enter the following 

java -jar dist/FreeEed.jar -param_file my.freeeed.properties

This will stage (that is, package into zip archives for processing) and then process all data
Note that the output directory (default is test-output/output) must be deleted before processing, 
or else processing will stop.

3. The output for this run is found in test-output/output. The load file is called
part-r-00000 or something similar. Rename it, giving it a CSV extension.
