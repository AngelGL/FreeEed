1. Download and unzip the distribution from GitHub. One possible place is
c:\FreeEed.

2. Open a command window and navigate to c:\FreeEed
Enter "cmd" in the Windows-Start box. You will see a black window open.
In this window type cd c:\FreeEed

3. On the command line enter the following 

java -jar dist\FreeEed.jar

This will tell you the list of options. It will also verify that you got the distribution.

Try the following

java -jar dist\FreeEed.jar -version (should tell you the version)

4. To package the input for staging, run the following command

java -jar dist\FreeEed.jar -input test-data\01-one-time-test -input test-data\02-loose-files

This will package two directories coming with the distribution into zip files. It will also tell you where the zip files are -
watch the output of the program.

5. To process in the local mode, run the following command (after having done staging)

java -jar dist\FreeEed.jar -process local 

*** Note that test-output/output must be deleted before processing, or else it will stop
