In Ubuntu

1. Unzip the distribution. We will call the place where you unzip it "the distribution directory"
2. On the command line enter the following 

java -jar dist/FreeEed.jar

This will tell you the list of options. It will also verify that you got the distribution.

3. To package the input for staging, run the following command

java -jar dist/FreeEed.jar org.freeeed.main.FreeEedMain -input test-data/01-one-time-test -input test-data/02-loose-files

This will package two directories coming with the distribution into zip files. It will also tell you where the zip files are -
watch the output of the program.

4. To process in the local mode, run the following command (after having done staging)

java -jar dist/FreeEed.jar -process local 

*** Note that test-output/output must be deleted before processing, or else it will stop
