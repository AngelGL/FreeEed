This instruction is for Ubuntu. At the moment, FreeEed is not supported in Windows or Mac, 
but you can look at sample processing results in the sample-output folder.

* Unzip the distribution. We will call the place where you unzip it "the distribution directory".
One possible place is ~/FreeEed

* To run the operator console, enter

java -jar dist/FreeEed.jar -gui

* Alternatively, you can use the command line; enter the following 

java -jar dist/FreeEed.jar -param_file sample_freeeed.project

This will stage (that is, package into zip archives for processing) and then process all data.
Note that the output directory (default is test-output/output) must be deleted before processing, 
or else processing will stop.

* The output for this run is found in test-output/output. The load file is called
part-r-00000 or something similar. Rename it, giving it a CSV extension.
