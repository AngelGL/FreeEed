The jars in the 'lib' directory are imported into the local .m2 repository, 
because they are not available anywhere in web-based maven repositories

These instructions assume that you are in the 'freeeed-processing' project directory
Q. Where is my maven in Windows?
A. In NetBeans, it's something like
"C:\Program Files\NetBeans 7.3\java\maven\bin\mvn.bat"

IMPORTANT
To run the maven import commands in Windows, you need to be in DOS, in the freeeed-processing directory

If you want to use the third-party proprietary driver for PST extraction, 
get the jar and do this (but you need the jpst.jar, which is licensed):


mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.ibm \
-DartifactId=notes \
-Dversion=7.3.4 \
-Dfile=lib/Notes.jar \
-Dpackaging=jar \
-DgeneratePom=true

Linux:
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.independentsoft \
-DartifactId=JPST \
-Dversion=1.0 \
-Dfile=lib/jpst.jar \
-Dpackaging=jar \
-DgeneratePom=true

Windows:
install_jpst_cygwin.bat

When testing, if you plan to use JPST, do the target assembly:single first

For PST processing, normally you would use readpst. JPST is a special case for Windows.
